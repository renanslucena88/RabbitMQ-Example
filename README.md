# RabbitMQ-Example
A simple example of how RabbitMQ works 




In this project, you will see a simple example of how to publish and consume messages using RabbitMQ.

To install RabbitMQ, download it here: https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html

I'm sending text messages just to show you a simple example. A Model with many properties can be sent using JSON format. So the message can be processed upon receipt.

Any question please send me an email: renansouto.lucena@gmail.com
